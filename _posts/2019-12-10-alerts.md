There are four alert styles:

{% include alert.html style="primary" text="A codelist is a list of valid code values for a variable. The purpose of a codelist is to ensure that data values comply with controlled terminology." %}

{% include alert.html style="success" text="A codelist is a list of valid code values for a variable. The purpose of a codelist is to ensure that data values comply with controlled terminology." %}

{% include alert.html style="warning" text="A codelist is a list of valid code values for a variable. The purpose of a codelist is to ensure that data values comply with controlled terminology." %}

{% include alert.html style="danger" text="A codelist is a list of valid code values for a variable. The purpose of a codelist is to ensure that data values comply with controlled terminology." %}

Add alerts to a post using the following includes:

{% raw %}
```yaml
{% include alert.html style="primary" text="A codelist is a list of valid code values for a variable. The purpose of a codelist is to ensure that data values comply with controlled terminology." %}

{% include alert.html style="success" text="A codelist is a list of valid code values for a variable. The purpose of a codelist is to ensure that data values comply with controlled terminology." %}

{% include alert.html style="warning" text="A codelist is a list of valid code values for a variable. The purpose of a codelist is to ensure that data values comply with controlled terminology." %}

{% include alert.html style="danger" text="A codelist is a list of valid code values for a variable. The purpose of a codelist is to ensure that data values comply with controlled terminology." %}
```
{% endraw %}
